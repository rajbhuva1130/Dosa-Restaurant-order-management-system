### Dosa Restaurant Order Processing System

This project aims to design a better system for processing orders for a Dosa restaurant. It includes a Python script that reads order data from a JSON file, processes it, and generates two JSON files as output:

1. `customers.json`: Contains customer information with phone numbers as keys and customer names as values.
2. `items.json`: Contains item information with item names as keys and details such as price and number of orders as values.

### Usage
change example_orders.json in command with your json file name.

1.To use the script, run it with the following command (Mac):
python3 dosa.py example_orders.json

2.TO use in windows, run it with the following command:
py dosa.py example_orders.json

3.if Any of command doesn't work, run it with the following command:
python dosa.py example_orders.json

### Example

An example order file (`example_orders.json`) is provided in the repository for practice purposes.
