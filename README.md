### Dosa Restaurant Order Processing System

This project aims to design a better system for processing orders for a Dosa restaurant. It includes a Python script that reads order data from a JSON file, processes it, and generates two JSON files as output:

1. `customers.json`: Contains customer information with phone numbers as keys and customer names as values.
2. `items.json`: Contains item information with item names as keys and details such as price and number of orders as values.

### Usage

To use the script, run it with the following command:


### Example

An example order file (`example_orders.json`) is provided in the repository for practice purposes.
